/**
 * house.c — THE MODEL.  ****  YOU WRITE THIS FILE  ****
 *
 * This is the layer that owns the data and applies the rules. Every function
 * below is declared in include/house.h — that header is the contract, and you
 * must not change it. Fill in the bodies marked TODO.
 *
 * It compiles and runs as it stands: you get an empty house and a working
 * menu. Each function you finish makes more of the schematic come alive.
 *
 *  THE SIX FUNCTIONS ARE IN THE ORDER YOU SHOULD WRITE THEM.
 *  Work straight down the file. Each one is marked [ N / 6 ].
 *
 *      [ 1 / 6 ]  houseInit()        FR-03   the rooms appear
 *      [ 2 / 6 ]  tempC()            FR-05   degrees and bars work
 *      [ 3 / 6 ]  applyRules()       FR-10   the three rules  <-- the big one
 *      [ 4 / 6 ]  rulesPass()        FR-10   sweep the whole house
 *      [ 5 / 6 ]  countRoomsWith()   FR-11   for the report
 *      [ 6 / 6 ]  sumAdc()           FR-11   recursive, for the report
 *
 * RULES OF THE HOUSE
 *   - Touch `status` ONLY through SET_BIT / CLR_BIT / TOGGLE_BIT / READ_BIT.
 *     Never `r->status = 5;` — that silently wipes the other four flags.
 *   - No float, no double. Integer maths only.
 *   - No malloc. The array below is the whole house.
 *   - Nothing in this file prints anything. Printing is render.c's job.

 *              *** THE BIG ONE — this is the heart of the project ***
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  REQUIRES : [ 2 / 6 ] tempC() must work — the rules compare temperatures.
 *  GIVES    : nothing visible on its own. [ 4 / 6 ] is what calls it.
 *  USES     : READ_BIT, SET_BIT, CLR_BIT, tempC(),
 *             BIT_AUTO, BIT_OCCUPIED, BIT_LAMP, BIT_FAN, BIT_ALARM,
 *             TEMP_HOT (28), TEMP_ALARM (45)
 *  CHECK    : do it together with [ 4 / 6 ], then press 5 twice.
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * THE THREE RULES, applied to ONE room, IN THIS ORDER:
 *
 *   R1  light follows people
 *         OCCUPIED set  ->  LAMP on,  else LAMP off
 *   R2  fan follows heat
 *         tempC >= TEMP_HOT    ->  FAN on,   else FAN off
 *   R3  overheat overrides R1
 *         tempC >= TEMP_ALARM  ->  ALARM on AND LAMP on,  else ALARM off
 *
 * A room whose AUTO bit is clear must be left COMPLETELY alone — return 0
 * immediately, before touching anything.
 *
 * Return 1 if the status byte changed, 0 if it did not. (Save the old value
 * at the top, compare at the bottom.)
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT COST MARKS
 *   - `if` with no `else`. R1 must turn the lamp OFF for an empty room, not
 *     merely fail to turn it on. Same for R2. Without the else, the bit gets
 *     set once and never clears, and every automation pass reports changes
 *     forever.
 *   - Getting R3's position wrong. R3 runs LAST and overwrites R1 on
 *     purpose, so an overheating empty room still lights up. In an if/else
 *     chain the last write wins — rule order is a design decision. Your
 *     README has to explain what happens if you move R3 first.
